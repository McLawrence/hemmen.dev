# About Me
I am currently writing my Master's Thesis in [Matthias Heins Group](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/maschinelles-lernen/news/) at the University of TÃ¼bingen, where I am working on robustness of artificial neural networks.
